Dear Reader

I set up this page to bring to light the difficulties being faced by tenants due to coercive methods being used by landlords in the middle of the pandemic.  

I am a resident at 100 Woodruff Ave Brooklyn NY. On ___ my landlord tried to force into my apartment and threatened to evict me.  

I have been a paying tenant since December 2018. The illusory tenant of record relinquished their claim to the apartment months ago & vacated the residence years ago. Despite this, I have been trying to sign a new lease for her current apartment since January 2020.  

After 5 months of threats, harassment, manipulation, and withholding a lease due to no fault of mine, Michael Weiss, the property manager, [broke into the apartment with a power drill—unannounced](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CDIeVskjie3/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link).  

On Thursday, July 23rd, the lawyers representing Parkway Realty served me with a 10-Day eviction notice. This unconscionable demand, on the heels of the burglary, at the peak of the Coronavirus pandemic, against a young, queer, Black, Chinese, femme is—at best—a hate crime, that has exacerbated her PTSD. And yet all I am asking for is dignity for her basic rights.  

I am one of the thousands in this precarious situation right now and would to bring attention to this situation.
