Dear Reader

I set up this page to bring to light the difficulties being faced by tenants due to coercive methods being used by landlords in the middle of the pandemic.  

I am a resident at <update> . On <update> my landlord tried to force into my apartment and threatened to evict me.  

I am one of the thousands in this precarious situation right now and would be glad to receive any support in my moment of need.
