Dear Reader

I set up this page to bring to light the difficulties being faced by tenants due to coercive methods being used by landlords in the middle of the pandemic.  

I am a resident at ____. On ____ my landlord tried to force into my apartment and threatened to evict me.  

I am one of the thousands in this precarious situation right now and would be glad to receive any support in my moment of need.

  paypal.Buttons({
      style: {
          shape: 'pill',
          color: 'blue',
          layout: 'vertical',
          label: 'paypal',
          
      },
      createOrder: function(data, actions) {
          return actions.order.create({
              purchase_units: [{
                  amount: {
                      value: '10'
                  }
              }]
          });
      },
      onApprove: function(data, actions) {
          return actions.order.capture().then(function(details) {
              alert('Transaction completed by ' + details.payer.name.given_name + '!');
          });
      }
  }).render('#paypal-button-container');
